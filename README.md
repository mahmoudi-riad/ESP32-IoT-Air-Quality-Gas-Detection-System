#  IoT Fire & Gas Detection System (ESP32 + MQ2 & MQ5)

A real-time gas monitoring system using an ESP32 and MQ2 & MQ5 sensors. Data is visualized via the Blynk IoT platform â€” accessible remotely on your phone or PC.   

##  Components Used
- ESP32 development board  
- MQ2 gas sensor  
- MQ5 gas sensor
- buzzer
- Wi-Fi connection (for Blynk)  

##  How It Works
1. ESP32 reads analog values from MQ2 and MQ5 and allarm you if there is gas with buzzer.  
2. Sends live data to the **Blynk app** (phone/PC dashboard).  
3. Remote monitoring of gas levels is available in real-time.
